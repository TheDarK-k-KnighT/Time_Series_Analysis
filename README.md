Time Series Analysis Case study

This project is performed on a time series data of a small city XYZ's monthly electricity consumption. The data has been collected for a time period from Jan 1997 to Dec 2006.
Time series techniques such as Holt-Winter forecasting method, ARIMA model, spectral analysis, transfer function model, etc. are used to generate models.
Using these models, forecasts for the next 6 months are calculated in the end.
